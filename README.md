# Airport Challenge in Javascript

While experimenting with Javascript as new language, we decide to challenge ourselves with a known program, the airport challenge, <a href="https://github.com/Debora38/airport_challenge">previously implemented in Ruby</a>. 

#### Original instructions from the Ruby version:
```
- Build an Airport
- Make planes land and take off
- Keep track of planes in the airport or in flight
- Add random weather condition as stormy or sunny
- Raise errors when a plane tries to land or take off in a storm
- Set an airport capacity
- Raise error when a plane tries to land in a full airport
```

### Approach in Javascript

This challenge was strictly test-driven, as we also made ourselves familiar with Jasmine as testing framework for Javascript.<br>

The above instructions were not fully implemented, mostly due to time management, as the week included 4 challenges to discover a new language.<br>

We started with a very familiar simple program as <a href="https://github.com/Debora38/fizzbuzz_js">Fizzbuzz</a>, experimented further with this airport challenge, then explored JQuery with the <a href="https://github.com/Debora38/Thermostat-js">thermostat model</a> and finally a weekend challenge where we implemented a <a href="https://github.com/Debora38/bowling-challenge">program to keep the score for bowling matches</a>.
